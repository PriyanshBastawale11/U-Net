# U-Net
### Goals
In this notebook, we are going to implement a U-Net for a biomedical imaging segmentation task. Specifically, we are going to be labeling neurons, so one might call this a neural neural network! :) 

Note that this is not a GAN, generative model, or unsupervised learning task. This is a supervised learning task, so there's only one correct answer (like a classifier!) this component underlies the Generator component of Pix2Pix in the next notebook this week.

### Learning Objectives
1.   Implement your own U-Net.
2.   Observe your U-Net's performance on a challenging segmentation task.
